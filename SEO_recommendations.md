# In-Depth SEO Recommendations for 716 Detailing

This document provides a detailed, specific SEO action plan for 716 Detailing to improve your ranking in a 15-mile radius of Lewiston, NY. This plan is based on an analysis of your website and your key competitors.

## On-Page SEO Action Plan

Your website has a good foundation, but there are critical on-page SEO issues that need to be addressed to improve your ranking.

### 1. Fix Your Heading Structure

**Issue:** Your homepage has multiple `<h1>` headings. An `<h1>` tag is the most important heading on a page, and there should only be one. Using multiple `<h1>` tags dilutes their importance and confuses search engines.

**Action:**
*   **Your current `<h1>` tags:**
    *   "NIAGARA COUNTY'S LUXURY CAR DETAILING SERVICE"
    *   "SERVING NIAGARA COUNTY'S FINEST COMMUNITIES"
    *   "WE GOT YOU COVERED"
    *   ...and several others.
*   **Change all of the above `<h1>` tags to `<h2>` tags, except for the main headline.**
*   **Your primary `<h1>` tag should be:** "Luxury Car Detailing in Lewiston, NY and Niagara County". This is a keyword-rich, geographically-focused `<h1>` that will immediately tell Google what your page is about.

### 2. Optimize Your Title Tag

**Issue:** Your current title tag is "716 Details – Mobile Detailing Service". This is good, but it can be more powerful.

**Action:**
*   **Change your title tag to:** "716 Details | Lewiston, NY Car Detailing & Ceramic Coating".
*   **Why:** This title is more specific, includes your primary location and high-value services, and is more in line with what your top competitors are doing.

### 3. Create a Compelling Meta Description

**Issue:** Your current meta description is good, but it can be more action-oriented.

**Action:**
*   **Your current meta description:** "Professional mobile detailing and ceramic coating for tasteful vehicle owners. We bring luxury car care directly to you in Lewiston, Clarence, East Amherst, and the surrounding areas."
*   **Recommended meta description:** "716 Details offers professional mobile detailing and ceramic coating in Lewiston, NY. We bring luxury car care to you. Book your appointment today!"
*   **Why:** This version is more direct, includes a call to action ("Book your appointment today!"), and is more concise.

### 4. Expand Your Service and Location Pages

**Issue:** Your service and location pages are a good start, but they lack in-depth content.

**Action:**
*   **For each service page (Ceramic Coating, Interior Detailing, etc.):**
    *   Add at least 500 words of content.
    *   Include details about your process, the products you use, and the benefits of the service.
    *   Add a "Frequently Asked Questions" section to each service page.
*   **For each location page (Lewiston, Clarence, etc.):**
    *   Add unique content about your services in that specific area.
    *   Include a customer testimonial from that location.
    *   Embed a map of the area.

## Local SEO Action Plan

### 1. Hyper-Optimize Your Google Business Profile

*   **Services:** Make sure every single service you offer is listed in your Google Business Profile.
*   **Products:** Add your detailing packages as "products" in your GBP.
*   **Q&A:** Proactively ask and answer questions in your GBP's Q&A section. For example: "Do you offer mobile detailing in Niagara Falls?" Answer it with a detailed response.
*   **Photos:** Add new, high-quality photos of your work at least once a week.

### 2. Build Local Citations

*   Get your business listed on these local and industry-specific directories:
    *   Yelp
    *   Yellow Pages
    *   Angie's List
    *   Niagara River Region Chamber of Commerce
    *   Buffalo Niagara Partnership

## Competitive Analysis

*   **Buffalo Car Care:** Their strength is their single, powerful `<h1>` tag and detailed service descriptions. You can beat them by creating more in-depth content and building more local backlinks.
*   **Hamilton's Auto Detailing:** Their website is very basic. You can easily outperform them by following the on-page SEO recommendations in this document.

## Prioritized Action Plan

1.  **Fix the heading structure on your homepage.** This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
2.  **Optimize your title tag and meta description.** These are easy wins that can have a big impact.
3.  **Begin expanding your service and location pages.** Start with your most popular service and your primary location (Lewiston).
4.  **Hyper-optimize your Google Business Profile.** This is essential for local SEO.
5.  **Start building local citations.**

By following this plan, you will be well on your way to ranking number one in your target area.
